# Linear-Algebra-and-Probability
### Linear Algebra and Probability Coding Assignment of Artificial Intelligence Module in University

Given a two-dimensional array, where each row represents an instance (or object). 
For each row, the first 5 columns are the attributes of the instance and the final column is the label of the instance.
main.py code have three functions:
1) Read the text file and parse its content into a matrix
2) Compute the prior probabilities p(l = 0) and p(l = 1) 
3) Compute the conditional probabilities p(ai =0|l=0),i=0,1,2,3,4andp(ai =1|l=0),i=0,1,2,3,4, 
   p(ai = 0|l = 1),i = 0,1,2,3,4 and p(ai = 1|l = 1),i = 0,1,2,3,4
